Excellent. This is the perfect way to frame the research. You're moving from just building tools to designing the experiment that will produce the insights you need. Your three questions are precise and answerable with the models we've discussed.

Let's address how to model Pillar 2 and then lay out the complete experimental plan to answer all three of your questions.

### How to Model Pillar 2: Endhost->Endhost Fairness

You're right, this is another distinct behavior. It's not greedy like the thundering herd, and it's not globally optimal like the LP solver. It's a form of **cooperative behavior**.

**The Logic:** "Fair" end-hosts understand that multiple paths exist. Instead of all picking the single best one, they coordinate (implicitly or explicitly) to share the available paths. The simplest and most effective way to model this is **equal load balancing**.

*   **Rule:** For any given traffic flow (from host `h` to destination `d`), find all available paths. Instead of sending 100% of the traffic down the best path, **divide the traffic equally among all available paths**, subject to capacity constraints.

This requires a new simulator, similar to the thundering herd one, but with this different core logic.

### New Script: `fair_share_simulator.py` (Models Pillar 2)

This script simulates cooperative end-hosts.

### The Grand Experimental Plan: Answering Your Research Questions

You now have a complete suite of four powerful models:
1.  **Cost LP Solver** (`model_with_destinations.py`): Models ISP-Optimal and ISP-Pessimal scenarios.
2.  **Time Optimization LP Solver** (`solve_time_optimization.py`): Calculates the theoretical maximum performance.
3.  **Thundering Herd Simulator** (`thundering_herd_simulator.py`): Models selfish, uncoordinated end-hosts.
4.  **Fair Share Simulator** (`fair_share_simulator.py`): Models cooperative end-hosts (Pillar 2).

Here is the concrete plan to use them to get the numbers you need.

#### Question 1: How big is the cost difference? (Baseline vs. SCION Worst Case)

*   **Goal:** Quantify the financial risk SCION's path freedom poses to an ISP.
*   **Models to Use:** Cost LP Solver.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Run `python model_with_destinations.py input.json output_min_cost.json --goal minimize`
    2.  Run `python model_with_destinations.py input.json output_max_cost.json --goal maximize`
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Compare the `objective_value` from `output_min_cost.json` (let's call it `C_min`) and `output_max_cost.json` (`C_max`).
    *   **The number you are looking for is the ratio `C_max / C_min`**. This directly answers: "The worst-case scenario can increase an ISP's transit costs by a factor of X." This is a powerful argument for needing **Pillar 1 (ISP Filtering)**.

#### Question 2: How bad is the performance in thundering herds?

*   **Goal:** Show the performance degradation from selfish behavior compared to a theoretical ideal.
*   **Models to Use:** Thundering Herd Simulator and Time Optimization LP Solver.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Run `python thundering_herd_simulator.py input_for_time.json output_thundering_herd.json`
    2.  Run `python solve_time_optimization.py input_for_time.json output_max_perf.json --goal maximize`
*   **Analysis:**
    *   From `output_thundering_herd.json`, get the `unsent_traffic_due_to_congestion`. A high number means the network is failing to deliver data.
    *   From `output_max_perf.json`, get the `transfer_duration_sec`. This is your benchmark for the best possible time (`T_best`).
    *   Calculate the effective transfer duration for the thundering herd (it might be infinite if traffic is dropped!). If it completes, compare its duration to `T_best`.
    *   **The number you are looking for is the amount of dropped traffic and the performance gap.** You can say: "Uncoordinated end-hosts lead to X% of traffic being dropped due to congestion, whereas a coordinated approach could deliver all traffic in T_best seconds." This justifies **Pillar 2 (Endhost->Endhost Fairness)**. You can even run the `fair_share_simulator` to show that it drops less traffic than the thundering herd.

#### Question 3: How big is the impact of ISP filtering?

*   **Goal:** Demonstrate that ISP guidance can solve the thundering herd problem.
*   **Models to Use:** Thundering Herd Simulator (run sequentially) and Performance Analyzer.
*   **Steps:** This is the feedback loop we discussed.
    1.  **Run A (Before Filtering):**
        *   `python thundering_herd_simulator.py input.json herd_before.json`
        *   `python performance_analyzer.py input.json herd_before.json`
        *   Note which egress links have >95% utilization and how much traffic was unsent.
    2.  **Create a New Input File:** Copy `input.json` to `input_congested.json`. In the new file, find the congested egress interfaces in the `egress_latencies` section and significantly increase their latency (e.g., add 50ms). This simulates the ISP's congestion signal.
    3.  **Run B (After Filtering):**
        *   `python thundering_herd_simulator.py input_congested.json herd_after.json`
        *   `python performance_analyzer.py input_congested.json herd_after.json`
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Compare the `unsent_traffic_due_to_congestion` from `herd_before.json` and `herd_after.json`.
    *   Compare the egress utilization from the performance analyzer runs for both.
    *   **The numbers you are looking for are the reduction in dropped traffic and the re-balancing of link utilization.** You can conclude: "By signaling congestion on overloaded peering links, the ISP can guide end-host selection, reducing dropped traffic from X to Y and balancing network load." This validates **Pillar 3 (ISP->Endhost Fairness)**.

This structured plan allows you to systematically generate the evidence needed to argue for the necessity of each pillar in a scalable SCION deployment.
